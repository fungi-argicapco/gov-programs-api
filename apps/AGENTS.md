Refer to root AGENTS.md for global constraints (Bun-only, Workers runtime, CF tooling).

Directory-specific expectations:
- Keep sub-module READMEs up to date when adding new Workers or front-end apps.
- Surface rebuild or deployment prerequisites (e.g., Vite build, wrangler bindings) alongside the relevant code.
- If a new app depends on additional infrastructure, update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and the root README.
