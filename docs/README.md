# Documentation Hub

Reference materials supporting development, deployment, and research efforts:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – System diagram and component responsibilities.
- `api-contract.md` – HTTP surface area and schema expectations.
- `admin-runbooks.md`, `d1-migration-runbook.md` – Operational procedures.
- `ingestion-observability.md`, `mvp-launch-checklist.md`, `phase-*` docs – Project-specific plans and checklists.
- `sprint-0-environment.md` – Execution plan and checklists for the environment readiness sprint.
- `schemas/` – Zod/TypeScript schema definitions for playbooks and related outputs.

Add new documentation here and link it from the root README when it is relevant to day-to-day development.
