Documentation guidelines:
- Use Markdown with UTF-8 plain text; include Mermaid diagrams when helpful (see ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Keep operational runbooks in sync with scripts and Workers; update when workflows change.
- Link new documents from the root README or relevant directory READMEs to keep navigation simple.
