# Deep Research Log

## Overview

This research project created a structured dataset for the top ten U.S. states by Gross State Product (ISO‑3166‑2 units: **US‑CA, US‑TX, US‑NY, US‑FL, US‑IL, US‑PA, US‑OH, US‑GA, US‑WA, US‑NJ**).  Each state entry includes information on **industry clusters**, **workforce ecosystems**, **infrastructure assets**, **regulatory profiles**, and **RAID (risks, assumptions, issues, dependencies) logs**.  A separate **source‑documentation** table records key metadata for every data source used.  The dataset is delivered in both CSV and JSONL formats to support flexible ingestion.

## Methodology

1. **Define scope and structure** – The user requested five tables (industry clusters, workforce ecosystem, infrastructure assets, regulatory profiles, and raid log).  I defined column names based on the requested attributes (e.g., sector, employment, GDP contribution) and decided to produce one row per state for each table, summarising key data across multiple sectors.

2. **Identify high‑GDP states** – Using the “List of U.S. states by GDP” page, I selected the ten states with the highest 2024 nominal GSP: California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Washington, and New Jersey.

3. **Gather industry data** – For each state, I opened economy pages or official economic development sites.  For example, the **Economy of California** page highlighted that California’s largest sectors by GDP are **information, real estate and professional services**, and that the largest employer is the **University of California**【16025826659863†L708-L736】.  The page also discussed the value of California’s agriculture exports (over **US$42.6 billion**)【16025826659863†L820-L835】.  Similar sources were used for other states (e.g., Texas economy【768241928370379†L432-L505】 and New York’s economy【334938837982675†L152-L176】) to derive sectors, employment patterns, and major employers.

4. **Collect workforce program details** – I searched state workforce development boards and program pages.  California’s **High Road Training Partnerships** invest **$28.5 million** to support healthcare training, with an emphasis on job quality, equity and climate resilience【403905054878861†L58-L101】.  Illinois’ workforce page listed programs such as **WIOA Works Illinois** and **Apprenticeship Illinois**, while a press release described **Clean Energy Jobs Act workforce hubs** that received over **$6 million** to train more than **400** residents【163821077485036†L75-L115】.  Pennsylvania’s **WEDnetPA** programme offers up to **$2,000** per employee for training and has served **24 000 companies** and **1.3 million workers**【475633660276941†L14-L90】.  Georgia’s **Quick Start** program has trained more than **1 million employees**【421518063159768†L137-L156】.  For states with limited accessible information (e.g., Ohio), general knowledge of state workforce grants (TechCred, JobsOhio) was summarised.

5. **Infrastructure assets** – Ports and airports were identified as critical infrastructure.  I used official port statistics or news articles to obtain TEU or passenger volumes.  For instance, the **Port of Los Angeles** handled **10.3 million TEUs in 2024**, a **19.3 %** increase【584277127530177†L292-L321】, while **Hartsfield‑Jackson Atlanta International Airport** served **108.07 million passengers** and **645 834 metric tons of cargo** in 2024【110421785373083†L249-L266】.  The **Northwest Seaport Alliance** processed **3.3 million TEUs** in 2024【427233726318915†L45-L51】, and **Philadelphia International Airport** handled **30.9 million passengers** and **449 000 metric tons of cargo**【766294595313693†L265-L284】.  Where specific infrastructure data was unavailable (e.g., Port of Philadelphia), estimates based on typical throughput were provided.

6. **Regulatory and incentive environment** – I summarised permitting timelines, incentives, labour and tax policies using general knowledge and state economic development sources.  For instance, Illinois’ **High Impact Business Program** offers investment tax credits and sales tax exemptions, with eligibility for renewable and energy projects【35491535789360†L124-L171】.  Texas was noted for streamlined permitting and the absence of a state income tax, while states such as Washington have longer environmental review periods.  Risk levels and mitigation measures were assigned based on the regulatory complexity and economic reliance of each state.

7. **RAID log** – For each state, I identified at least one risk linked to regulatory or infrastructure context.  Examples include environmental permitting delays in California (due to CEQA reviews), port capacity constraints in Georgia (despite a 5.6 M TEU throughput and expansion plans)【796573735497601†L131-L138】, and climate‑related risks for Florida’s coastal infrastructure.  Mitigation measures such as early regulatory engagement or resilience investments were proposed.

8. **Document sources** – A source‑documentation table was created for every website or article used.  Each entry records the URL, whether authentication is required, update frequency, change‑detection method, readiness, contact information, verification date, relevant keywords, ESG focus, and notes citing evidence from the source.  This ensures traceability and helps plan future updates.

9. **Compile data tables** – Using Python, I built pandas DataFrames for each table and populated them with the collected information.  Files were saved as CSV and JSONL to the shared directory.  The tables include full descriptions rather than shorthand codes, making them self‑explanatory.
