# Data Assets

This directory stores research artifacts, source registries, and local ingestion datasets.

- `sources/` – Source definitions, registries, and supporting archives for automated ingestion.
- `lookups/` – Sample lookup tables used when KV is unavailable locally.
- `ingest.dev.sqlite` – Local SQLite mirror generated by `bun run ingest:once` (gitignored).

Keep sensitive or large datasets out of the repository unless specifically approved; use R2 or external storage for production data.
