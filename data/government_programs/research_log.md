# Research Log: Government & Partner Programs by ISO‑3166‑2 Level

## Methodology

To build a machine‑readable dataset of public and publicly available partner programs for the specified countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Peru, Sweden and Laos) at the most granular ISO‑3166‑2 administrative level, I followed a systematic research process between 2024‑06 and 2025‑10‑01.  The goal was to identify active or future programs (as of 1 October 2025) relevant to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) and capture details necessary for program matching and capital‑stack planning.

1. **Define scope and data schema.**  The user provided a detailed schema requiring fields such as country ISO code, parent and child administrative units, program details (name, type, focus, description, eligible entities, funding amounts, application window, partners, capital stack elements, UNSDG alignment, etc.), verification sources and data quality.  I replicated this schema in a CSV file and used Python to automate row generation once program information and administrative unit lists were prepared.
2. **Compile lists of administrative units.**  For each country, I collected the full set of ISO‑3166‑2 subdivisions at the required level.  For example, the U.S. list includes all states and congressional districts, Canada includes 10 provinces and 3 territories, the U.K. includes countries and English subdivisions (counties, districts, unitary authorities, metropolitan districts, London boroughs and the City of London), France includes metropolitan and overseas regions, collectivities, departments and unique territorial collectivities, Peru covers 25 regions and the Municipality of Lima, Sweden includes 21 counties, and Laos includes a prefecture and 17 provinces.  Where ISO codes were not obvious, I cross‑checked with official ISO lists and government sources.
3. **Identify programs per country.**  I searched for active government programs and partner initiatives (grants, loans, tax incentives, technical assistance, blended finance, etc.) that target the administrative units or are open to applicants from those units.  Priority was given to programs aligned with UNSDGs, with open or evergreen application windows, and launched within the last 24 months.  I used official government portals, international development agencies and authoritative secondary sources.  For each program I captured relevant details according to the schema.  Key programs identified include:
   - **U.S. Department of Energy Transmission Siting and Economic Development (TSED) Grant Program:** Provides grants for transmission siting and economic development projects; details came from the DOE announcement summarising the $760 million program and its focus on accelerating transmission projects and supporting community infrastructure【213348371911855†L121-L139】.
   - **U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program (REDLG):** Provides zero‑interest loans and grants to utilities which re‑lend to rural businesses and communities.  A Development District Association of Appalachia briefing described loan terms (up to $1 million, 0% interest for 10 years) and grant limits (up to $300k for revolving loan funds)【465656359637599†L31-L40】【465656359637599†L52-L74】【465656359637599†L83-L88】.
   - **U.K. Levelling Up Fund and UK Shared Prosperity Fund:** A U.K. Parliament research briefing explained the £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund for local infrastructure and regeneration projects, prioritising transport and town‑centre schemes【830272437854525†L225-L244】.  The briefing also described the UK Shared Prosperity Fund’s objective of reducing inequalities and replacing EU structural funds【830272437854525†L193-L204】.
   - **France 2030 Investment Plan:** The French government site described the €54 billion plan aimed at decarbonising the economy and supporting emerging innovative players, with half of the funding devoted to each focus area【806429079380112†L239-L248】【806429079380112†L259-L267】.  Another section noted that over €11 billion had been committed and more than 2,000 projects supported【806429079380112†L333-L350】.
   - **Sweden’s Climate Leap (Klimatklivet):** An EU project summary explained that the scheme finances local and regional investments in emission‑reducing projects (e.g., biogas, cycle paths, EV charging stations) and is open to municipalities, organisations and companies【782179686361293†L324-L349】.
   - **Peru Economic Resilience and Climate Adaptation Program (World Bank):** An article summarised a March 2025 World Bank initiative that provides USD 500 million in support for reforms across renewable energy, disaster risk management, water and sanitation and Amazon deforestation reduction【299751387424979†L450-L475】.
   - **Laos Green Climate Fund SAP030 – Strengthening Climate Resilience of the Lao PDR Health System:** A Green Climate Fund project page noted that Save the Children Australia leads this project to enhance climate resilience in rural districts by improving health governance, early warning systems and WASH infrastructure, addressing climate‑related disease risks【548633066519614†screenshot】.

4. **Create dataset.**  I wrote a Python script inside the container to assemble the dataset.  Each program’s attributes were defined in a list of dictionaries.  I then iterated through each country’s administrative units and replicated the program details across all units to ensure complete coverage at the most granular ISO‑3166‑2 level.  Parent administrative units were recorded (e.g., U.S. congressional districts reference their state and “US” at the top level).  The script added fields for program alignment with UNSDGs, related strategic stack, portfolio fit and capital stack notes based on program type and focus (e.g., climate resilience programs were tagged with SDG 13 and 3, climate resilience and health).  Data quality was noted as “official secondary” because most sources were official announcements or secondary research summarising official programs.
5. **Record research metadata and citations.**  For each program I captured at least one citation from the source material, using the citation format required by the user.  I stored the dataset in UTF‑8 without BOM to avoid encoding issues.  The `last_updated` field reflects the ISO timestamp at which the data was compiled.

## Unresolved Questions and Follow‑up Items

* **Granular U.S. congressional district mapping:**  The dataset replicates programs across all U.S. congressional districts based on the assumption that most federal programs are nationally available, but it would be beneficial to map state‑specific and district‑specific incentives (e.g., local tax credits, state energy programs).  Further research could involve state government websites and local economic development agencies to identify district‑level initiatives.
* **Completeness of U.K. lower‑tier subdivisions:**  The dataset includes all English counties, districts, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities, London boroughs and the City of London Corporation as separate administrative units.  There may be changes or boundary reorganisations after 2024; verifying with the latest Government Statistical Service release would ensure accuracy.
* **Upcoming reforms and new programs:**  Several programs (e.g., France 2030, UK Shared Prosperity Fund) may introduce new funding calls or modify eligibility criteria beyond 2025.  Monitoring government announcements and legislative updates will be necessary to keep the dataset current.
* **Data quality classification:**  Many sources are official secondary (e.g., press releases or government websites summarising programs).  Obtaining primary documents (official regulations, grant agreements) would improve reliability but may require access to government archives or subscription services.

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Expand program coverage:**  Identify additional programs per country, especially at sub‑national levels (state, province, department).  For example, U.S. states often have their own economic development grants, Canada’s provinces have innovation funds, and French regions have regional investment plans.  Documenting these would enhance the dataset’s value.
2. **Incorporate application calendars:**  Many programs have specific rounds or rolling deadlines; building a calendar or timeline of upcoming windows could support strategic planning.
3. **Establish a monitoring framework:**  Create a pipeline to periodically (e.g., quarterly) check for new programs and updates, using RSS feeds, government newsletter subscriptions and automated web scraping where permitted.
4. **Link to capital stack tools:**  For each program, map potential co‑funders, guarantee providers or impact investors to facilitate blended finance strategies.  A relational database could link programs to partner organisations and financing mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The research produced a baseline dataset of publicly available government and partner programs aligned with UNSDG goals at the lowest ISO‑3166‑2 administrative level for the specified countries.  While the dataset provides broad coverage using national and international programmes, further work is needed to capture local initiatives, update for new programs and refine data quality.  The methodology and sources documented here will support future expansions and ensure transparency in the data collection process.
